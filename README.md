# Gender Detection From SMS Text Meaasge Using Machine Learning
Short message service (SMS) has become a very popular medium for communication due to its convenience and low cost. It is easy to provide a false name, age, gender, and location in order to hide ones true identity. So it becomes imperative to design an efficient method for identity tracing in cyberspace forensics.
# Overview
Comparison of two approach for gender identification is performed:                                                                         
	[1] Based on n-gram feature                                                                                                           
	[2] Based On Manually extracted 5-set of features                                                                                     
Comparison on two classification algorithm:                                                                                               
 	[1] Naive Bayes                                                                                                                       
 	[2] Support Vector Machine(SVM)                                                                                                       
Identify which feature is important to predict the gender
